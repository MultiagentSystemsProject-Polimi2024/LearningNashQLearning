# LearningNashQLearning

This is an educational project to see the inner workings of the Nash-Q Learning algorithm. The Nash-Q Learning algorithm is a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that is designed to learn Nash equilibria in general-sum stochastic games. This project is designed to be educational and is not intended to be used in production environments.

## What's in here?

You can find the following subpackages in this project:

- **Model**: Contains the implementation of the Nash-Q Learning algorithm as well as a wide range of classes to define Stochastic Games.
- **View**: Contains the implementation of a wide variety of widgets to visualize the Nash-Q Learning algorithm. They are designed to be used in python Notebooks via the ipythonwidgets library.
