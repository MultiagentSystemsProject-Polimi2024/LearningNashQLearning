    "# Nash-Q Learning Educational Software\n",
    "This project aims to create an educational software that could be used by anyone interested in learning about artificial intelligence, specifically in the area of multi-agent systems and the Nash-Q learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to make the process that agents follow when applying the algorithm to explore a new environment more understandable. This includes showing how the agents' knowledge of the environment updates at every step, how they make decisions about what actions to take, and their final internal representation of the environment after training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you can select a number of agents to train (between 1 and 4), and edit the environment where they will be trained, or chose one of the available presets. After that, it will be possible to run a training session for the agents, after setting the parameters for this phase. Following the training, the results will be displayed in a dedicated section."

    "If you decide to use one of the presets already created, you just need to select it from the dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available presets will be explained here:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Empty preset that only selects the minimum number of **players** (2) and 2 **games**\n",
    "1. Defines an environment with 2 **players** and 2 **games**, with deterministic transitions and equal **payoffs** for each **player** on every transition, set in such a way that the agents should be led to **game** 1, where it is best for them to stay because of the **payoffs**. This means that the only *Nash-Q equilibrium* is playing the **action profile** (0, 0) in both the games.\n",
    "2. Defines an environment with 3 **players** and 2 **games**, again with deterministic transitions and equal **payoffs** among the agents, where the goal state is **game** 1 and the *Nash-Q equilibrium* consists of playing the **action profile** (0, 0, 0) in each game.\n",
    "3. Like the two previous presets, it features deterministic transitions and equal **payoffs** for all the players, with the *Nash-Q equilibrium* in the **action profile** (0, 0, 0, 0), but this time with 4 **players**.\n",
    "4. A more structured preset that tries to recreate the famous *\"Prisoner's Dilemma\"*, often use as an example in *Game Theory*. In this situation two **players** interact in an environment made up of 4 **games**;  \n",
    "\n",
    "    **0** - in the starting **game** (**game** 0), the **players** are two criminals that have been captured and are offered a choice, individually, without the possibility of knowing the other prisoner's choice. They can either *(S)* stay silent, or *(T)* testify against the other prisoner. Given the possible choices, the combinations are 4: they both stay silent *(S, S)*, one of them testifies and the other stays silent *(T, S)*, and the other way around *(S, T)*, and lastly they both testify *(T, T)*. The **payoffs** are set in such a way that there is no difference in confessing or not if the other confesses, but remaining silent when the other confesses causes a pretty big negative reward. In this **game** the *Nash-Q equilibrium** is confessing for both **players** *(C, C)*.  \n",
    "    **1** - In **game** 1, both the criminals have testified, and are both imprisoned. In this game the prisoners are given the possibility of playing rock, paper, and scissors to determine which one of the two will be release; this means that they can play 3 actions: rock (R), paper (P), and scissors (S). The one that wins gets a positive reward because he gets released, while the one that loses gets a bigger negative reward because his sentence is increased; in the case of a tie, they both get a small negative reward, because they need to stay in prison with their sentence.  \n",
    "    **2** - In **game** 2 one of the criminal has testified, while the other has remained silent, so the first is free and the second is in prison. The free one has the choice between *(H)* helping the other criminal escape, or *(I)* ignoring him, while the prisoner can choose between *(E)* escaping or *(R)* remaining in prison. If the first tries to help and the other wants to escape *(H, E)* they both get a small positive reward, while if the second decides to remain in prison *(H, R)*, he gets a small negative reward while the other gets a negative reward because he is inprisoned too; if the first decides not to help and the second tries to escape *(I, E)*, the second gets a negative reward because he can't actually escape without help, and his sentence is increased, while the first gets a null reward; if the second remains in prison *(I, R)*, the second gets a small negative reward while the first still gets a null negative reward.  \n",

On the edge of the graph relative to the current action and transition, it is also possible to see the differences from the previous values in the *Q-Table*.\n",

You should note that the *Q-Tables* will be shown only when the number of players is less than 3, because it wouldn't be possible to display a structure with more than 2 dimentions in the interface."
